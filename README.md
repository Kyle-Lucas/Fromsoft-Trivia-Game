# Multiple Choice Trivia Game
An App/Game that Randomly Gives a Question and 4 Possible Answers to choose from Based on the Data its given

This was coded using Kivy 2.3.0, a Graphics User Interface (GUI) Python Framework, so if you plan to edit and use this you will have to install Kivy.

I coded this app with the initial idea of a Trivia Game based on FromSoftware's Soulsborne Games
How ever the App can be given any Data to read and Apply and will work the same as long as the Data provided is formatted as below:

\n
A Question\n
The Correct Answer to above Question\n
A Wrong Option/Answer\n
A Wrong Option/Answer\n
A Wrong Option/Answer\n

For Example, below is from data.txt used in this App:

\n
What is the Name of the Onion Knight in Dark Souls 3?\n
Siegmeyer of Catarina (Right Answer)\n
Siegward of Catarina\n
Siegmayer of Catarina\n
Sieglinde of Catarina\n

The Code is set up to read the Data this way, so you can just keep adding as many Questions with Answers as you want, without changing or modifying the Code/Program
